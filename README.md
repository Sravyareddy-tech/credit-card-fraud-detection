# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This data analytics project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning techniques.

## Tech Stack
- *Python*
- *Pandas, NumPy*
- *Matplotlib*
- *Scikit-learn*
- *Tkinter* (for the GUI)

## How It Works
The application uses a machine learning pipeline based on the *Random Forest Classifier* to detect fraudulent transactions. A GUI built with Tkinter allows users to upload credit card datasets, run training/testing, and view prediction results.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SravyaReddy-tech/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
   cd credit-card-fraud-detection
